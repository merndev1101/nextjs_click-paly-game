            The CPS test is a free online game that measures a number of clicks
            per second. The click speed test consists of calculating your click
            speed with your mouse over a given time, which will give you a
            result in {"CPS"}.
          </p>
          <p>
            {" "}
            To start, click on {"Start the click speed test"}. The timer starts
            with the first click, so you have to place the mouse on the area,
            put your hand on it, and click as quickly as possible on the same
            area during the time allotted to you.
          </p>
          <p>
            {" "}
            A timer will count down from the first click to the time that you
            have left to play. You will be given a 5 second time interval as a
            default to practice, but you can adjust the time and default options
            in the menu.
          </p>

            How is the score calculated in the CPS?
          </h2>
          <p>
            {" "}
            Once the test time has elapsed, you will be able to obtain your
            final score which will be presented in CPS (clicks per second). This
            result in CPS calculates the average number of clicks made compared
            to the duration of the CPS tester; i.e. a ratio of the number of
            clicks by the number of seconds played (CPS = number of clicks /
            number of seconds). The faster you click your mouse, the higher the
            CPS counter will score.

            How should I choose the time interval for the click test?{" "}
          </h2>
          <p>
            To maximize your chances of receiving high scores and achieve the
            fastest clicks per second, choose a time interval of 5 seconds. 5
            seconds is the time set as a default and will allow you to obtain
            the best CPS scores that you can. With any other selection of time
            beyond the default of 5 seconds, the CPS tester will not be able to
            provide you with the most accurate result to your capabilities. We
            consider 5 seconds to be the most appropriate amount of time to test
            as anything longer will result in your finger being slowed down over
            time. It is best to use the lesser interval for the most accurate
            results.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our CPS tester is free and can be taken as many times as you would
            like. To restart, click on the {"Try again"} button and you can
            practice several times to try to improve your score and your click
            speed ability. A score of 6 to 9 clicks per second is considered to
            be a good click speed and is the average scored rating. Did you know
            that the world record was 14.1 CPS, according to Google? Take part
            in the speed clicker test experiment and be prepared to compete with
            formidable players, and beat the best scores on the net!

          <h2 className="more-pages-title"> Our tips for always clicking</h2>
          <p>
            faster We have a few helpful tips for you to achieve the best scores
            possible. There are techniques and body positions that allow you to
            always click faster. To date, several methods are recognized to help
            you improve your speed of clicks, but the best advice we can give
            you is to always have your hand relaxed. By using two fingers, you
            can become even faster. Make sure that the distance between your
            finger and the mouse are minimal to save time and increase the
            amount of possible clicks. Be sure to press the button gently and
            not too hard as you may cause the mouse to move and slow down the
            frequency of the clicks.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our last recommendation would be to consider the kind of mouse that
            you are working with. We recommend that you bring a specialized
            gaming mouse that will help you increase your click rate by being
            more flexible and more suitable. Make sure your mouse is correctly
            installed and is fully optimized for its sensitivity settings to be
            able to participate in our CPS test. And, be aware that the keypad
            touch screen of a laptop computer is less powerful than a mouse.

            It is important to note to our users that you may benefit from a
            strong internet connection. As the test is played online, it is
            necessary to have a stable internet connection.
